            <p class="fst-italic"><strong>In Short: </strong>We only process your personal information when we believe
              it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like
              with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our
              contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="fst-italic" style="text-decoration: underline;">If you are located in the EU or UK,
                  this section applies to you.</span></strong></p>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we
              rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
              to process your personal information:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
              <li><strong>1. Consent: </strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e.,
                consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any
                time. Click <a href="#account-info" style="text-decoration: underline;">here </a> to learn more.</li>
              <li><strong>2. Performance of a Contract: </strong>We may process your personal information when we
                believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services
                or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. </li>
              <li><strong>3. Legitimate Interests: </strong> We may process your information when we believe it is
                reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh
                your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal
                information to analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users.
              </li>
              <li><strong>4. Legal Obligations: </strong>We may process your information where we believe it is
                necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
                regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
                litigation in which we are involved.</li>
              <li><strong>5. Vital Interests: </strong>We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
                to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
                potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><span class="fst-italic" style="text-decoration: underline;">
                  If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</span></strong></p>

            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use
              your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred
              (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#account-info"
                style="text-decoration: underline;">here </a> to learn more. </p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
              without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
              <li>&#9679 If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
                timely way</li>
              <li> &#9679 For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
              <li>&#9679 For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
              <li>&#9679 If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process,
                or
                settle an insurance claim</li>
              <li>&#9679 For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
              <li>&#9679 If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
                financial
                abuse</li>
              <li>&#9679 If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability
                or the
                accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
                breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
              <li>&#9679 If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the
                court relating to the production of records</li>
              <li>&#9679 If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession
                and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
              <li>&#9679 If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
              <li>&#9679 If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

            <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
